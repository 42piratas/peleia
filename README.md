# Peleia
Peleia is a board game freely adapted from [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego).    

## What does the word 'Peleia' means?   
From Spanish: _[n]: fight; struggle_ . It's also a word used in Brazil, rather in the south of the country, from where the creators come :-)    

## How to play 
The rules are the same of Stratego, the difference being the adapted characters and the slightly adapted board (although one could play with the original board as well). 

For each character from Stratego, Peleia has an equivalent adapted character, these being caricatures of typical _south Brazilian_ people.

You can find the game's manual in the resources of this repository, where you also can find the blueprint of the game's board. 

## Creators
The game was created by my friend [@fpaganini](https://github.com/fpaganini) and me. It took us a couple of years between first thinking about creating the game and finishing its first version :-)
